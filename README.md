# TradeNetwork-Scratchproj

To run simply go in to the project directory and compress all of the files to a single zip (it must be within the file, not the file itself)

Then rename the resulting zip file to have the sb3 extension instead of your compressors default extension.

This file can then be uploaded onto the scratch 3 site.


\*Tested to work with the default windows compression tool
